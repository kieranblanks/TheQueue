  <h1 class="sectionabout"> About <i>The Queue</i></h1>
  <p><i>The Queue</i> was developed by Kieran Blanks and Bettina Johnson as a public safety tool to seek out equitable businesses after reflecting on the tragic deaths and historic mistreatment of African-Americans in the United States. There is a gap between where we currently are, and where we should be in terms of equitable treatment for all.</p>

  <p>According to the American Psychology Association, racism is defined as “a personal belief in the superiority of one’s race over another. It is linked to racial prejudice and discriminatory behaviors, which can be an expression of implicit and explicit bias.” </p>

  <p>These unfair biases are reflected in our everyday life, and our mission at <i>The Queue</i> is to bring light to the businesses that practice equitable and fair treatment for everyone.</p> 

  <p><i>The Queue</i> is a safety tool that allows for consumers to maintain the safety of themselves and their loved ones. We believe that it is important to make the best economic decisions based on what businesses value and appreciate them as patrons.</p>


  <p>CPO Kieran Blanks, an experienced human-centered research and design professional with over ten years of experience in both traditional marketing and user-centered design, brings the passion and ideas that power <i>The Queue</i>.</p>
